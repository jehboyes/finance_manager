On-costs
^^^^^^^^

On-costs are the costs of employment beyond basic salary. Typically, in addition to paying an employee's hourly rate for the number of hours worked, 
the institution will also pay **National Insurance** contributions and **Pension** contributions (which are distinct from the employ\ **ee**\ 's NI and Pension contributions, 
paid from the employee's salary along with income tax).

In the cases of Fractional posts and Casual posts, there is also a 'holiday accrual' on-cost: this is an increase to the hourly rate derived from the amount of holiday pay 
that an employee would have recieved, had the work been contracted. This is often a source of confusion and mis-perception of hourly rate of Fractional staff, which is often stated as the amount *before* 
the applciation of holiday accrual, or the `Teaching Uplift`_.

Teaching Uplift
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An employee's hourly rate is increased when they are teaching, on the premise that on average, each hour of teaching incurs 19 minutes and 17 seconds minutes of preparation time. 
Therefore, an employee's hourly rate is increased by 32.14% when they are teaching (but not assessing). 

The 19 minutes and 17 seconds is usually rounded to 20 minutes in communications, but this is only a shorthand: the 32.14% uplift is what is actually applied. 

Fractional Academic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a type of post that has a new 'Fractional Contract' each year, which details what the post will teach or assess in that year. 

Though fractional academic staff costs are grouped under as 'variable costs', they are not flexible, as the institution is obligated to keep 
the total number of hours contracted broadly consistent between years, where possible. 

The word 'fraction' is a reference to when the institution provided Further Education: at this time, a contract's 'fraction' was the proportion of the total FE term time spent teaching, it is therefore analogous to 
a Full-Time-Term-Time-Equivalent, which would be a larger number than the **F**\ ull-\ **T**\ ime-\ **E**\ quivalent.  

Teaching contracts therefore had both an FTE *and* a Fraction. The 'fraction' figure disappeared from the teaching contracts in 2017.
