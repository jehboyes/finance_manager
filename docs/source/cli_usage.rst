Creating sets
-------------

The process of setting up a new round of sets, for a given set category and academic year. 

This is most easily done using the ``fm ops newset`` command, which generates 
new sets for each cost centre. 

The command takes four required arguments, for each of:

- Set category - the set_cat_id for the sets being generated
- Academic year - see :term:`Academic Year`. 
- Curriculum ID - an ID for a curriculum in the :doc:`cm` 
- Student Number Usage - the type of student numbers to use with the sets.
