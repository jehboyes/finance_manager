Finance Manager System
======================

Welcome to the complete guide to the Finance Manager, a system for managing financial planning at Leeds Conservatoire. 
Though there are various aspects that are idiomatic to the conservatoire, with little alteration 
the system could be implemented to any Higher Education Institution. 

The system is under active development. The ultimate aim of the project is to produce a system that is a one-stop for 
monitoring finance data, reactively adjusting forecasts, and building budgets. 

The system encompasses two distinct applications: 

* A web app for end users to interact with financial planning data 
* A command line interface for planning staff to manage financial planning data
