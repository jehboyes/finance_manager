HEI Finance Manager
===================

Welcome to the complete guide to the Finance Manager, a system for managing financial planning in a Higher Education Institution. 

The system is under active development. The ultimate aim of the project is to produce a system that is a one-stop for 
monitoring finance data, reactively adjusting forecasts, and building empirical budgets. 

The system encompasses two distinct applications: 
1. A web app for end users to interact with financial planning data 
1. A command line interface for administrative users to manage financial planning data
