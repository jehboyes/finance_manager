Finance Manager System
======================

Welcome to the complete guide to the Finance Manager, a system for managing financial planning at Leeds Conservatoire. 
Several aspects of both the codebase and the documentation are very specific to the conservatoire, but with 
little alteration the system could be implemented in any Higher Education Institution. 

The system is under active development. The ultimate aim of the Finance Manager project is to produce 
a system that is a one-stop for monitoring finance data, reactively adjusting forecasts, and building budgets. 

The system encompasses two distinct applications: 

* A web app for end users to interact with financial planning data 
* A command line interface for planning staff to manage financial planning data
